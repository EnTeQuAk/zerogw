 `+` is scheduled before 1.0 release
 `-` definetly not blocks 1.0 release (but still may be done)

 + resolve_url in http_headers should probably differ (do not reply too early)
 + strange ECONNRESET on read from client (maybe previous issue?)
 + Find out rare startup failure (probably related to already opened connections after restart

 Websockets:
 + Add error pages for http polling
 + Implement or disable more output and input formats for polling
 - Review ws.js, limit number of requests, introduce queue, data batching
 - Implement pseudo peer-to-peer communication support (?)
 + Fix simple polling (timeout=0)
 - Implement routing messages by prefix
 - Maybe prefix routing should work with xrep sockets by subscribing
   on specific prefixes/topics, so it uses just one socket not lots of them
 + Make Push by default (probably in the 0.6 or 1.0)
 * Do something with connect/disconnect if queues are full
 - Make a way to send message to all users

 Static:
 * implement directory index
 * implement cache
 * implement gzip
 * implement expires (cache-age)
 * implement If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match

 + Check EINTR in all zmq_send
 + Check what happens on ECONNRESET, EPIPE
 + Check working server with ZMQ_HWM's set on sockets
 * Strip `?` from uri before matching
 - Implement fallback routes
 + Setuid, chroot, etc.
 + Maintainance page
 + Allowed methods, and max-body-size
 + Add access logging
 - Authentication and simple authorization
 * Configuration reloading
 - HTTPS
 - Add server name-version header
 + Check server in low memory, and requests > max conditions
 - Configuration of zeromq devices in zerogw config
 - Figure out how to implement SDCH
 - Replace ugly offsetof's to SHIFT macro
 - Add another kind of forwarding (pushing) requests for statistics
